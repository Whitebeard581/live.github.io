                            Dragon Age Origins, The Best Game To Ever Exist:
                        </p>
                        <p id="recommendationdump">
                            Dragon Age Origins was a game, unlike any game that ever or will ever exist. It is quite literally perfection.
                            I remember when I was first recommended it by the owner of the gameshop near my house. I went there to purchase
                            games as much and as often as a teen could, and on one of my trips there, I was recommended by the owner of the
                            gameshop this "new game" that he was just sold in second hand games. The only copy of it he had, used or new. I
                            remember him talking up about how good the game and considering I am a big fan of Role-Playing Games(RPG), he told
                            me I should buy it to play it. Especially considering I was always on the look out for new RPG games. So, I paid for
                            the game, went home, and popped it into my Xbox 360 to play it. I will admit it though, when I first played it, I really
                            did not like the game and didn't understand what exactly was going on. The first thing that got me in, I would say, 2013 to
                            2014ish, was how bad the graphics actually were by that point. Now, mind, the game was released in 2009 to 2010. So, there had
                            be a remarkable jumped in graphics, however, even compared it to other games that came out, most still had a more pleasant look
                            to them, especially the character creation. So, for me at the time, having not really understood what was going on with the story
                            and with the look and feel of the game and gameplay, I basically muddled through the game the first few times around. Sure, it
                            wasn't exactly a very difficult game, but I had no idea what to do or even how to do most things since the tutorial and quest
                            guidance was not very intuitive. I remember one of the main missions, where you had to save an organization from demonic possession,
                            and the one tool to do it was added to your inventory, but it was not automatically added to the quick bar and it was not made clear
                            it was stashed in the inventory, I got very confused and ended up getting locked into choices I did not like, because as a child, it
                            wasn't like I had that great of a understanding or comprehension for the more, not as intuitive gameplay aspect of the game. It was
                            the same as with character companions of the game as well. I did not really liked any of them since I could not, as a young child,
                            really clicked with any of them. I just basically played the game on auto-pilot and after a few false starts, finally completed the
                            game, feeling extremely underwhelmed and wondering if I was sold a bill of goods by the game shop owner.

                            Well, dear readers. That is where I am happy to say that was not the case. As I already bought the game and since it came highly recommended,
                            I decided to just give it another try or two, just to give it a fair shot so I could properly judged the game, as I had at least a little bit
                            more of an understanding of the game and it's game mechanics, I thought, well, i'll just choose the easiest to play class and see how it went
                            from there. Welp, how it went was this, I fell in love with the game, the game world, the story, the lore, the gameplay mechanics and just the
                            game itself. It showed itself to be a super solid game, which offered a lot to its players if they would be willing to tolerate some of its flaws.
                            And tolerate I did. Not just tolerate, actually, I embraced the very flaws of the game that completely baffled me in the first place. Getting used
                            to all aspects of the game wasn't easy, but I worked through it and it surprised me in the best way possible, by offering me everything I was looking
                            for in a game, and things I didn't even know were things I was looking for in a game. A compelling story with great companions who helped make the
                            adventuring and interaction with the world so much better and so much more colourful, and with the stellar supporting cast of characters, it truly
                            pushes DAO into the stratosphere.
                        </p>
                        <p id="recommendationdump">
                            The setup for the game is simple enough. A hero is given the call to journey and for whatever reason, is either denied it or is rejected by the hero,
                            however, it is during those times when the hero's destiny calls. It propells the hero on a world saving journey, and ultimately, the hero truimphs over
                            evil, and the land is saved. Simple setup. The excecution on the other hand, was so, so much better. The premies is this, the Player Character(PC) is first
                            given a choice of 6 distinct backgrounds, human noble, elf commoner or normadic elf, human/elf mage, and finally, dwarf noble or dwarf commoner. Each
                            of the different background opens up so many distinct interactions, quest and world and lore for the players to go through with. After the players have
                            chosen their race, background and class, they are introduced to each of the settings and after playing a certain amount of the background, the main character
                            is introduced to the grizzled mentor character, ala Obi-Wan, Yoda or so on, and is then given an introduction to the heroic, world saving faction that they
                            will join or be forced to join to be able to save the world. The mentor character then interacts with the PC and informs them that there is a world ending threat
                            and he is out looking for new potential recurits to bolster their organization's rank and help to save the world from the evil that is to come. What's great about
                            this introduction is that, even though all the typical hero fantasy stuff is there, you are given the option to treat the mentor character and the hero's journey
                            however you want. So you can either be receptive to the idea, or, you can hate it so much, you also treat the mentor character like they are an enemy. The world's your
                            oyster. Following the meeting with the mentor, the PC continues their journey through the prologue that is the background story of your choice, and once they reach
                            the end, the mentor character returns and recurits in the PC. While of course, players are unable to deny the request, you are still given an option to role-play.
                            So for example, if players chooses the elf, they can act like being forced into the organization is further slavery that their race has to endure and later on, through
                            out the entire journey, the PC can basically act out and role-play as a human hating character. Conversely, they could also role-play the typical bright eye hero, who
                            is happy to be recurited as they are now able to show the world their worth and save the people from the great evil. All manners of ways that players can take what is given
                            to them, and play it however they so choose. Even if there is, at the end of the day, some limitations. The next part of the journey following the recuritment, is the
                            meeting of the king of the nation the PC is in and the introduction to the threat(or reintroduction if PC plays as dwarf noble.) that they will be facing during their timer
                            as the hero. Meeting three other very important characters who will shape how the PCs can alter their views on how they view the organization they are now in. And while all
                            of this is going on, against the backdrop of a massive war, PCs can also meet another of the companions of their journey and said companion's mother. Two very mysterious and
                            secretive witches with their own agendas and their own histories at play and out of all these things going on, the biggest introduction to the philosophy of the order they are
                            in now is this, sacrifice the few for the good of the many. Which will play out in the form of a story section in which all the new recurits must undergo a ritual in which
                            they ingest poison and should they live, they will be accepted fully, and should they fail, die. When one of the other two recurits gets cold feet, he is killed by the mentor
                            character. Sacrfice of the few for the many. A terrfic play on players expectation of a fantasy world and that of the heroes journey. You are expandable and your death, that
                            of just the few, is for the betterment of the many, which will ultimately inform how the endings can play out. The culmination of the ending for just this still just prologue
                            is with the death and dishonour of your organization and the king and his army, betrayed by his closest general and destroyed by the evil army. You are safe by the witch and her
                            daughter for their own purposes and ultimately, must set out to look for allies to amass an army to not just replenish the one lost at the first war, but also to take down the
                            now tyrant general who has strong armed his daughter into following his lead and command as he tries to unify all of the opposing sides under his daughter. However, things will not
                            be easy as everyone of the potential allies are all also facing problems of their own. War with mythical beasts, political intrigue, demonic possessions, just to name a few, the hero's
                            journey has just ended up becoming even more complicated. Which is something I love as this sets up so much potential and it was potential that was well grapsed by the game devs
                            and the ideals and stories they set out were magnificent, even if there were small flaws here and there.

                            You add all that together with super likeable companions and friends, and you get a super well rounded journey and game, where players can easily immerse themselves into and just get lost
                            in everything that the game has to offer. So, I'll just put it as such. When I first picked up the game, I had little to no expecations for it. It was actually worse after I played through the
                            intital two or three times, before fully completing the game. However, due to the fact I stuck it out with the game, I just got more and more immersed in all that was presented and given to me
                            the player and I can't be anymore happy that I did. Being recommended this game was the most life changing experience I have to say and while there were many things that has since gone on in my
                            personal life, I can say without a shadow of a doubt, this game is everything it is cracked up to be and more. There is nothing else quite like it and it shows, even when compared to way more
                            technologically advance games, I still find myself coming back to play it time and time again, and getting lost in the experince again and again. When I say this game is the best ever to exist,
                            I am by no means joking. Play it yourself, give it a chance and you will find a whole new world out there for you to explore and get immersed in. Seal of approval definitely.
