                            Why BANNERS is the best Singer:
                        </p>
                        <p id="recommendationdump">
                            The first ever song from BANNERS that I heard, was Start A Riot. It was a terrific song, set to the ending
                            of one my most fav shows at the time, Lucifer. While the show itself has fallen out of favor with me, due to
                            the continous emsaculation and demonization of the male lead(which I will leave you, dear readers, to work
                            out the reason why. Which, spoiler alert, has to do with the main lead's immutable characteristics.), the song
                            and the singer on the other hand, has only grown on me more and more and more with each passing day. I live to
                            listen to BANNERS songs, due to how good it is. While I may not like every songs, he has put out more then enough
                            bangers for me to without exaggeration, declare him one of the all time great singers to ever live. It is criminal
                            how he is not yet heardled as one of the greatest singers to ever live, and hasn't made as much money and gained as
                            much accolade as singers like Michael Jackson, Elvis Presly, Whitney Houston and so many titans of the music industry. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="recommendationdump">
                            It cannot be overstated how much I treasure the songs put out by BANNERS. Songs such as Perfectly Broken, my fav song ever.
                            Holy Ground, Ghost, Start A Riot, Name In Lights, It's Gonna Be Ok and so many more, you would think he was a machine, with 
                            how many great songs he has put out. The beats of the songs are great and each fits around the story he is telling with each
                            of his songs. His voice, adds on the quality that binds everything together to create songs that really rivals pretty much every
                            other singers out there right now on the market. So, again, it is nothing but criminal that he has not yet been recognized amongst
                            the legends of the music industry. There is just nothing quite like listening to a BANNERS song. Good music with great storytelling.
                        </p>
                        <p id="recommendationdump">
                            An example of this greatest I spoke of would be with my favorite song, Perfectly Broken. It is a love song and tells a great story of
                            how your other half, exists out there that will complement and fit you perfectly to a tee by being "broken" in exactly the way needed to
                            perfectly compliment your own brokeness and your own imperfections. Together, the two halfs of both indiviuals will come together to form
                            one perfect union of beings and bring about the kind of "perfection" that had been missing in both indiviual's lives. It's why that even if
                            both parties are broken and nowhere near perfect, and no one, can or should try and "fix" you. You are perfect and beautiful simply
                            because of your imperfections. And just like the lyrics says "cause all of the scars and the bruises, they're what make you human", and just
                            because you aren't perfect, do not doubt yourself or put too much undue pressure or blame yourself for being "Not Perfect" because no one is
                            perfect. Everyone is broken in their own unique and beautiful and to say otherwise, to say that all the life expereince you went through only
                            makes you a worse human being is just not true and not to believe not just what other people may say, but what that little voice inside your heard,
                            where you doubt and hate and demean yourself, do not listen to it. Take soloace in the fact that you are you, perfect in your own little imperfect
                            way and it makes you all the more perfect by accepting that. By learning to believe and love yourself. And know too, that out there, somewhere in the
                            world, there is someone who is broken in just the perfect way to compliment you. It may not be easy or quick to find such a person, but they exist
                            and when you do, both of your brokeness and imperfections, will compliment each other and the both of you will find your own perfectness in one another
                            and will come together to form both your perfection in your imperfections. Which, hey, is a terrfic and uplifing and great message and story to tell someone.
                            Is life's journey gonna be easy or smooth? No. But we need more people pushing the message that, yeah, you are who you are. You are not perfect and your bruises
                            and your scars are a reflection of your own journey and life expereicnes. Do not be ashamed or embarrased by what is there. Accept that you are who you are,
                            due to all those imperfections you picked up along the way.
                        </p>

                            So yeah, great messages and great songs and great storytelling and great everything. BANNERS is the type of artist one can continously listen to and find so much
                            to love and believe in and to hold and cheris. BANNERS's songs should and I personally belive, the kind of benchmark more and more musicians should strive towards
                            as BANNERS magic, while never being able to be duplicated, should still be emulated as greatness is as greatness should be and from the way I see it, BANNERS is
                            already greatness incarnate and is the best musician all round.
