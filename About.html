                            Now, let's start with some introductions, shall we. My name is MR NEET00RAN. The most handsome and beautiful
                            entertainment critic in all of creation. For it is through, ME!!! That the world of critic stamps from.
                            Yes. I remember the day where critics of anything was not allowed. Yes... BUT, I and I ALONE, changed that.
                            For YOU. The uneducated and unwashed common masses. Yes, I led the REVOLUTION and changed this world for the
                            better. Through MY tireless efforts, you, the ever peasants are now allowed to critic and talk and judge the
                            state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture" class="linksdecoration">Pop Culture</a> and
                            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4651513/" class="linksdecoration">Geek Culture</a>.
                            Yes, how fortunate that ME, the lord and savior, MR NEET00RAN, is here for you, the common and unwashed masses.
                            <br>

                            Now, I am sure you are asking yourself this, "Why is our lord and savior, MR NEET00RAN, the most kind, generous,
                            handsome, beautiful, world saving and just all-round saint, sacrficing so much for us, the uneducated and unwashed,
                            common masses?". Now, that is a great question to ask. So let me, MR NEET00RAN, explain it to you. You see, during
                            the anicent time, where the world had yet to form, MR NEET00RAN ruled over the entire cosmos. There was no life, no
                            time, no nothing. But with a wave of MR NEET00RAN's great and mighty hand, the world came to be. With another wave
                            of MR NEET00RAN's hand, life came into being. And over the years it took for the unwashed and uneducated masses to
                            come into full sentient, MR NEET00RAN came to the world and blessed it thee, with the arts, literature, music and
                            other forms of entertainment. However, MR NEET00RAN saw the abuses of his great gifts, and so, came down into the
                            world of the unwashed and uneducated messes and decided to sacrfice himself to make it so that one could enjoy his
                            gifts, without the persecution of the other unwashed and uneducated masses.

                            it is just a hair's breath from turning bad. Give to it what you would give to yourself. For MR NEE has seen the
                            end and destruction of so many properties. Like One Piece, Dragon Ball, Doctor Who, Star Wars and more by people who
                            either hate their own products or have long since lost their light in their chase for Fool's Gold. Never forgot the
                            teachings of MR NEET00RAN and all will be well with the world. Love Entertainment as Entertainment loves you. So my
                            gathering of critics and fans. Love as you would love the last piece of chocolate. Love as if you would love the last
                            piece of fried chicken. For if you love entertainment, entertainment will not disapoint you and someday, surely. You
                            will at last come across another piece of good entertainment to replace the broken lasts. So keep faith my followers
                            and take heed in my love of you. Remember and love.
