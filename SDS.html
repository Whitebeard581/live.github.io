                        <p id="recommendationdump">
                            Seven Deadly Sins, as a manga, is a sterotypical Shounen manga. It doesn't try to break the mold, nor does it
                            really try to reinvent any thing. Which is perfectly fine for a series that sells itself for what it is. It
                            is a Shounen series about Arthurian legends, re-told through the lens of a Shounen series as a fantasy story.
                            Much like the Shounen series Kingdom, which is about the dramatized historical re-telling of the rise of the
                            first China emperor and his empire, alongside historical Chinese generals. The series is dramatized and molded
                            to fit the Shounen/Seinen formula, just with less magic and dragons. SDS is basically that but with the Arthurian
                            legends and boy, does Nakaba Suzuki bring it. The greatest appeal of the story for me isn't the Shounen formula used,
                            but rather the characters in the series itself. Each of the main cast has something about them that makes them so
                            interesting, each with their own problems, histories and mistakes that they all committed. To the rest of the world,
                            they are treated like criminals for having committed "crimes" at some point or another in their time. But as the series
                            progress on, you learn about the true history of each of the characters and learn about their struggles, pains and suffering.
                            They each contribute something to so good and interesting to an otherwise really generic Shounen fantasy series. Which I think
                            really sets it apart. That it is a series that takes a known and well use formula and rather then try and do something like break
                            the formula and try and make it something it is not and should not be, works everything in to the series and presents the whole
                            conflict in a direction that isn't usually seen alot. Polishing gold until it glitter and shine. Highlighting the great characters
                            created for the series, like the sexy female version of Merlin, or the super Gigachad Escanor. Each of the very well written
                            character and supporting cast brings something to the table that overall, enhances everything good about the series.

                            Which, to be fair, isn't that surprising as if you have read any of Nakaba Suzuki's prvious work, you can see he is very good
                            at what he does. My favorite has to be Kongo Bancho, where he also wrote another Gigachad character in Akira Kongo. Writing good
                            and Gigachad like characters seems to be the man's forte. In fact, he doesn't just write Gigachad characters, he actually knows
                            how to build them up and keep them as the Gigachads that he wrote them as. Something a series like One Piece absolutely have no
                            idea how to do because in the story of One Piece, written by Eiichiro Oda, only the Straw Hats matter and everyone else is just There
                            for them main characters in the Straw Hats to completely destory. Whereas, someone as good at writing good characters and interested in
                            building them up and keeping them the main attraction of the show, someone like Nakaba Suzuki, or someone like Osamu Nishi, author of the
                            great series Welcome to Demon School Iruma-kun, who is interested in building up the characters around more then just the main characters,
                            takes a careful and methodical approach to creating and maintaining all that is good about each of the characters, from the good guys to the
                            bad guys in the story, which in turns, builds up the anticipation to seeing not just the good guys overcoming the bad guys, but to see just
                            what each of the bad guy character can and will do in the story. Giving the entire story it's edge and driving each of the plot and interest
                            in seeing how the story progresses. Which, again, is something a series like Seven Deadly Sins does so well, and something a garbage series
                            like One Piece use to do well, before it nose dived into the dumpster.
                        </p>

                            So, with all that said, the story still always finds ways to impress me. With the biggest of that being the introduction of the character Escanor.
                            From the moment he was introduced, Nakaba Suzuki chose to write him the like Gigachad that he is. As a normal scrawny human weaker then a child
                            in his base form with no access to his magic powers, he is still written to be a honorable charatcer who would more than be willing to sacrifice
                            his life for his friends and also, as a man well in touch with his more artistic side. However, in the day, where his powers are active, he is written
                            as the ultimate Gigachad who is more Gigachad then even all Gigachads themseleves. He is more confident. Way too confident. However, he possess the powers
                            to back up said confidence by one shotting two of the most powerful bad guys all on his own. So regardless of which version of him is presented, he is
                            always shown to be in a class of his own and with how his arc progresses and how the story and author chose to end his story, man, it makes me shed manly
                            tears the likes of which I haven't shed that often for anything, dear readers. And do take into account again that this is only one of seven very interesting
                            story and characters amongst the main casts that we got to focus on. The other six were just as interesting, with each of their ups and downs and by the end,
                            you just can't help be impressed by what Nakaba Suzuki wrote. Especially with how he ended the story on a compelling ending that still allows him the freedom to
                            write sequels should he so chooses. Which, he did, but we don't talk about the sequel in the same way we don't talk about the Naruto sequel, considering how
                            badly they butchered the remaining cast. But with all that said, for the series which gave birth to the Gigachad, you can't really find that many faults in it
                            because at the core of the story, it about the Gigachad who went out like a Gigachad, by protecting his friends and giving his life to ensure that the rest of his
                            friends are able to enjoy life and enjoy all the good things that they all fought so hard for to protect... Well, at least that is the take away I got from the story.
                            GIGACHADS 4 LIFE YO!!!!!
